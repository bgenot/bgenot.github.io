A tiny world
======
よろしくお願いします! Welcome! I am Baptiste, a researcher at the University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences. We are located on the Kashiwa campus in Chiba prefecture. Our graduate school encompasses a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. You will discover on these pages that I am focusing my studies on tiny photosynthetic organisms from fresh or seawater habitats. How did photosynthesis machinery evolve and what are its specificities in old or forgotten photosynthetic eukaryotes are the main questions that motivate my research. I also work on photosymbiosis using different models such as the sea anemone Exaiptasia. I am interested to understand how the host and the symbiont can communicate and how photosynthesis machinery can differ when the algae is free-living or a symbiont.  



A worldwide journey

I started science in France near Paris city. When I was a student, and I think we all went through this, I found it hard to find my way. I think I chose biology after a microbiology training. When I realized that I could observe and manipulate microscopic bacteria. I understood and visualized how scientists were working and how they can understand and cure diseases or resolve ecology issues. From there I couldn't stop learning and my University journey started....
I was surprised to see that plants and crops were subjected to diseases like us. Bacteria, viruses, fungi... there are so many tiny things that can impact our environment and our food supply chain. I was in reality not comfortable working on animal subjects and found that plant science was the right choice for my master's degree. Working around plants was also relaxing and better understanding their biology was actually satisfying. Anyway, this is how I ended up working on plant innate immunity and protein kinases in France, at the INRA/Paris-Saclay Institute.

After a break, I had the opportunity to join an Ocean sciences lab in Maine, USA. I had time to think after my PhD and I was happy to leave Paris and Arabidopsis. It looks like a big change but not really. I was still working with photosynthetic things after all. There I had many opportunities to enlarge my skills and satisfy my curiosity. I worked on a unique example of vertebrate-algae symbiosis, I went to sea in the middle of the Gulf of Maine to tow plankton and sediments, and I extracted RNA from animals  I had no idea existed... The algae resource center there was huge and we had direct access to a wide range of species, most of them being almost not studied....so I ended up working on glaucophytes and could make a nice story about how these cells react to stress. It was wonderful to produce original research and work with students and I felt that I accumulated a lot of experience in science. After almost four years I had to leave for Japan as a position at the University of Tokyo was waiting for me...

I am now in Japan to continue my journey, please enjoy these pages and discover my research!
