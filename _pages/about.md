A tiny world
======


A worldwide journey
======
I started science in France near Paris city. When I was a student, and I think we all went through this, I found it hard to find my way. I think I chose biology after a microbiology training. When I realized that I could observe and manipulate microscopic bacteria. I understood and visualized how scientists were working and how they can understand and cure diseases or resolve ecology issues. From there I couldn't stop learning and my University journey started....
I was surprised to see that plants and crops were subjected to diseases like us. Bacteria, virus, fungus...they are so many tiny things that can impact our environment and our food supply chain. I was in reality not comfortable working on animal subjects and found that plant science was the right choice for my master's degree. Working around plants was also relaxing and better understanding their biology was actually satisfying.
