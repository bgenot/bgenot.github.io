I had the chance to study a unique example of photosymbiosis in vertebrates.
The yellow spotted Salamander is bearing green algae inside its body and its cells. Here is a picture that I took using light sheet microscopy. I artificially colored the algae in green so we can observe that many single-cell algae are found inside the body of the animal.

Here is another picture using standard fluorescence microscopy. You can see a couple of algae (in red, I used a FISH probe to detect the algae) inside the animal.
